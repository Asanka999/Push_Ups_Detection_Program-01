# Push_Ups_Detection_Program-01
Push-ups are a great bodyweight exercise that target multiple muscle groups, including the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. They're simple to do and can be modified for different fitness levels.

Here's how to perform a standard push-up:

Start Position:

Get into a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
Your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.
Engage your core and keep your back flat.
Lowering Phase:

Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them at about a 45-degree angle to your body.
Go down until your chest almost touches the floor (or as low as your body allows).
Push-Up Phase:

Push yourself back up by straightening your arms, returning to the starting position.
Tips:

Keep your elbows slightly bent during the entire movement.
Don't let your hips sag or your back arch. Maintaining a neutral spine is key.
If it's too challenging, try modifying by doing them on your knees.
